# Phase 0 — Open by Design

This phase exists for one purpose: radical transparency.

---

## Progress, shared openly

This page will be a live record of our work—decisions made, steps completed, and
milestones reached. No polished storytelling. Just honest progress, shared as it happens.

---

## Clear, consistent messaging

We will communicate what we are doing, why we are doing it, and what comes next—clearly
and repeatedly—so everyone stays aligned, informed, and engaged.

---

## Challenges, not hidden

We will openly publish issues, constraints, and roadblocks as they arise. These realities
are part of building something meaningful, and sharing them creates opportunities for
local insight, collaboration, and solutions.

---

## An invitation to participate

By making our process visible, we invite educators, community members, and well-wishers
to contribute knowledge, guidance, and support—where it truly helps.

---

This phase is not about perfection.
It is about trust, clarity, and collective momentum.
